SMM4H2022KZjjec0xf5VaPrYt	ADE	tysabri infusion #54 yesterday. made me feel tired and out of it for a while. maybe it's the heat - 34c (94f)!!! maybe a very hot summer?
SMM4H2022MQuenQcSVHOfdSLv	ADE	@USER_____ i had a gene test for tysabri i guess it can cause a fatal brain disorder. my chances are low.. but that crap is creepy.
SMM4H2022PVwtY0F4fg0eEeh1	ADE	have any of you developed knee pain since starting tysabri ? what helps with the problem ?
SMM4H20221eT3J6rJ2oqXXGX9	ADE	i have put on weight (thanks ms and #tysabri). always look on the bright side: time for a @USER_____ t-shirt spree! #winning
SMM4H20220rChjGmP6hSFpK2V	ADE	anyway, i was just feeling itchy and my neck was red so they gave me benedryl with my #tysabri. might be a coincidence but just in case
SMM4H2022gpxH8etHi2e0F11l	ADE	i need more energy today. don't know where to get it from, though. this is the result of going off #tysabri for #msandlife and heat-related.
SMM4H2022XpK6oAzKG96IhI5r	ADE	why must i be so tired. this spell better just be new med beginnings &amp; go away! #tysabri
SMM4H20227MmLZtJE5FWPENMh	ADE	tysabri bruises are the best HTTPURL_______________
SMM4H2022ONOZGurpLXFzAVEk	ADE	wondered why my limbs ached and i was shivering on the hottest day of the year so far. forgot my venlafaxine. that'll be withdrawal then!
SMM4H2022e6NHOFIPRmPJ0Rea	ADE	@USER__________ Venlafaxine gave me horrendous nightmares, & coming of it was horrific.!
SMM4H2022mDKg3W12hi5cN43S	ADE	seem to be feeling a bit better. disturbed sleep is a problem though. #venlafaxine #day15
SMM4H2022EAcyijCLPfG02nH9	ADE	i can't see the point in taking #venlafaxine it's screwing up my sleep &amp; i'm pretty sure it's not helping with the depression.
SMM4H2022CZyPQmDl9PRGfUst	ADE	@USER___ same with venlafaxine, 1 user I spoke to yrs ago stopped taking that when she started having acid like trips losing hours at a time
SMM4H20227XjAnbKOtw7hpWOK	ADE	as are (probably) the nausea, headache, sweats, flu symptoms &amp; diarrhea. but it's still better than being on it.  #venlafaxine #withdrawal
SMM4H2022p7maR5thpAgocf9Q	ADE	@USER______ venlafaxine definitely does mine. also makes me need 15 hours sleep a day. hence now unmediated &amp; rollercoastery.
SMM4H2022Ca8G4xpiVhlXVxwz	ADE	@USER_________ @USER______ apologies if gatecrashing. I was like walking dead when first started venlafaxine, much better now dose stable
SMM4H2022T4hmzV336tvPolbG	ADE	@USER_____ i'd consider restarting the venlafaxine today but it was messing with my sleep big time :( i'll go back to dr x
SMM4H2022PRroZTQ1EI1qVPqa	ADE	@USER_________ i might go back on the venlafaxine &amp; give it another chance but it was wrecking my sleep :( x

SMM4H2022tP4gLVWmlBdAEGLI	ADE	@USER____ Off Venlafaxine which was pure hell for me, I can't switch these meds anymore, tired of feeling like shit all day.
SMM4H2022dXyHpYXMkGIjL5uJ	ADE	@USER_________ venlafaxine was always awful for that. like someone sprayed hairspray all over my tongue... eww isn't a strong enough word!
SMM4H2022lacusSLxLO1ipHIZ	ADE	coming off 150mg venlafaxine over 14 days was a better idea in discussion. my brain feels like its actually vibrating! #willpower
SMM4H20226oDjeuRpyPJAjoSF	ADE	anyone who will listen: never ever take effexor/venlafaxine. paraesthesia abound.

SMM4H2022bsI3F5VF8xeoDgu8	ADE	@USER__________ yeah,  generic Venlafaxine has about four different slow release formulations,  I got withdrawals from some.
SMM4H2022K7GLg9he20TedqUS	ADE	packing whilst experiencing venlafaxine withdrawal is pretty hellish. got to keep track of my med times.
SMM4H2022GwzUi7DqYO7gOWe5	ADE	@USER_________ not that i ever noticed. i was taking it with venlafaxine, and it definitely made me drowsy
SMM4H2022THAxFCgLcffkZVUG	ADE	@USER_________ @USER_________ i didn't find it any more sedative than just venlafaxine alone. prob a little less so :)
SMM4H2022Pvxy43KlnUc0DWhe	ADE	@USER_ @USER______ venlafaxine withdrawal is worse than most by miles x
SMM4H2022HTfyhYjscvwFUOqF	ADE	i just have to remember that what i'm feeling is the withdrawal from the venlafaxine. when my meds come, i will get better.
SMM4H2022O500uvOMPL6a3hQK	ADE	but i'm happy to be clean. just really really really really really really really sucked going from 100mg desvenlafaxine / day to zero.
